The earliest interesting experience in my lifetime that I can recall, is the time I went out of state for a family reunion. We were staying at this super nice hotel & everyone decided to go to the swimming pool. I couldnt have been more than 9 years old but I was fearless, so of course I decided to jump in the pool on the deep end and almost drowned if it wasn't for my uncle diving in after me.</p>
