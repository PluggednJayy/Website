  <p>
    I created this online store to provide you with the best experience possible. I set out on my own journey of Health & Wellness about 2 years ago.
    In that time, I have put together a simple and straight to the point guide 
    as well as products that will aid you on your journey to becoming the most healthy version of yourself. You will find almost every answer to every question you may have as well as information that you can put into action today to begin living a healthier lifestyle.

<h3>About Me</h3>
  <p>
    <span style"color:green;"><strong>I was born & raised in Greenwood,Mississippi, a place that is called the cotton capital of the world.</strong> I come from a large but close knit family that would come together every sunday after church, every holiday, & even most birthdays enjoy each other. 
    Of course that also meant lots of cooking, so the women would be in the kitchen preparing all kinds of soul food dishes while the men would be outside on the grill.
    As we all know the Soul Food is the most health focused style of cooking, and actually if we're not careful it could be consider quite the opposite. That is very apparent when you look at the health conditions many of our people face as they continue to grow older. 
    Coming from that kind of upbringing and culture, is how I decided that not only do I want to change my lifestyle into one that would give me longevity, but also I want to reach back and get people to start to make better choices about what they put into their bodies today, in contrast to years down the road when the doctor does.</span>

  <p><h3>Blog</h3></p>
  <p>Recently, I started learning to become a web developer. This is actually the second project that I have worked on during my journey.
    I am being introduced to new information each day that builds on what I learned the day before and that in itself is exciting. A quick overview of what I have learned so far:
    the standard format from which all web pages start & many of the different elements and tools that are used to customize the resulting webpages that we use everyday. What's most interesting to
    me is how code can be very simple but very complex at the same time & also how it translates to a webpage as the end result of what would seem like a bunch of words, abbreviations, and symbols.
